# W02D01 - TDD, CommonJS, and NPM

### To Do
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Making assertions
- [x] Bringing in outside code
- [x] Exporting our code
- [x] Intro to NPM: a Node package manager
- [x] Mocha test runner
- [x] Ignoring files/folders
- [x] Chai assertion library
- [x] What is TDD?

### Unit Testing
* testing the smallest pieces of our code (ie. functions)
* call a function with known arguments
* expect to get back a predictable result
* testing the actual return value against the expected return value

### Node
* created by Google
* C++ program around the V8 engine
* Node added various packages to help us out


import export (ESM)
module.exports require (CommonJS) 



```bash
$ npm install mocha # install as a dependency of our project
$ npm install --save-dev mocha # install as a development dependency
$ npm install --global mocha # install as a global dependency on your OS
```

### What is TDD?
* Test-Driven Development
* the tests are written before the code
